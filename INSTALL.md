Conda tips:\
Get out of the current conda environment : 

	conda deactivate
View the available environments : 

	conda env list


## Create and activate a conda environment to run the script

- Download and extract the "cell_separation_analysis" repository.

In a terminal:
- Navigate to the "/cell_separation_analysis" folder that you have downloaded:

		cd path/to/cell_separation_analysis/
Where you replace "path/to/" by the actual path that leads you the folder "/cell_separation_analysis".

- Define a new conda environment:

		conda env create -f cell-sep-env.yml

- Activate the environment:

		source activate cell-sep-env


## Check your installation

You can run the test samples in ipython in the newly installed environment

- In a terminal run:

      ipython

This will launch ipython.

- in ipython navigate to the "/cell_separation_analysis" folder that you have downloaded:

      cd path/to/cell_separation_analysis/

- In the python console, type:

      %run Cell_separation_analysis.py
 
This should run the script, output and create images.
